This are my old Flash projects/utils/parts of commercial projects.
Small nostalgy upload to keep my very old sources somewhere :)

## Mankala
Was my first-ever coding on AS3 after my AS1/AS2 experience

## Fog
Is a test challenge to create a simple visual effect.
Implemented there my own DistortionMap variation.

## Gallery
Another test task to create simple gallery navigation using PureMVC (which I tried
first and time in my life. I like more RobotLegs)

## Utils
Different small utils:
* **Debugger** - traces the message by adding information in which class/method/line this trace was called
* **AssetResourcesLoader** - analogue to BulkLoader, but provides possibility to create a lot of
copies of loaded content from loaded bitmap data. It is not independent tool, just wanted to keep it here
* **TwitterController** - integration with Twitter API
